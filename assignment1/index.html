    <p>1.What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</body>p>
    <p>The first thing I paid attention to was my interaction with the mouse. Whenever I would move the mouse it had a white trail attached to it creating a cool effect similar to a snake. 
     Its animation was very cartoonish yet fluid, reminding me of something off a video game. </p>
