  <!-- I put a sc of his page to show what it looks like under the link -->
  <body>
    <!-- I linked the website I was analysing with its name, so viewers can click and see it themselves -->
    <br />
    <strong>1. </strong> What was the first thing you paid attention to when
    interacting with the experience?
    <!-- For the numbering of each question I decided to use the strong element to help mark each question and differentiate it from the regualr text -->
    <!-- I wanted to align all the text in the center as it gave it a more cleaner look, so I put all the text to center -->
    <p class="text-center">
      The first thing I paid attention to was my interaction with the mouse.
      Whenever I would move the mouse, it had a white trail attached to it. This
      created a cool effect similar to that of a snake. Its animation was very
      cartoonish yet fluid, reminding me of something from a video game.
    </p>
    <br />
    <!-- I put a break between each question to give the right amount of spacing between them each, not overcrowding text -->
    <strong>2. </strong> Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list
    of each of your discrete actions.
    <!-- Lists and border lists are also in the center as well to align with the rest of the text. -->
    <div class="center-list">
      <br />
      <ol class="small-border-list">
        <li>Moving around with the mouse</li>
        <li>Hovering over texts</li>
        <li>Hovering over images</li>
        <li>Scrolling down and horizontally</li>
        <li>Clicking links and buttons</li>
      </ol>
      <br />
    </div>
    <br />
    <strong>3. </strong> What part of the experience did you spend the most time
    engaging with?

    <p>
      I spent the most time engaging in the middle of the website when he was
      showcasing all of the work he has created. His different works are linked
      in the title, taking you to its page when you click on it. I spent a lot
      of time looking at his different work as well to see what he has done.
    </p>
    <br />
    <!-- I left the question just on the body whilst the answers are in paragraphs, 
     I did this as I wanted to customize the answers style in a type of border -->
    <strong>4. </strong> What was the most common action in your two minute
    interaction with the experience?

    <p>
      My most common action was simply hovering over texts and objects, waiting
      for a response or effect to happen after. It was the action needed for
      most of the interactions to work and show their full effect.
    </p>
    <br />

    <strong>5. </strong> What is your impression of the intended primary goal of
    the interactive experience?

    <p>
      The overall intention was probably for him to showcase his overall skills
      for websites and coding. He wanted us to experience his own personal
      skills by implementing a fun website on which we can see what hes capable
      of doing. We made the website like this so we can interact and play with
      it while also viewing his previous works as more examples for us to know
      about him.
    </p>
    <br />

    <strong>6. </strong>How does the interactive experience communicate this
    primary goal?

    <p>
      The primary goal of the website is to showcase his web development skills.
      This is effectively communicated through the design and functionality,
      which engage users with multiple interactive elements. These interactions
      not only demonstrate the creator's technical abilities but also highlight
      his talent for crafting unique and visually appealing websites that stand
      out from most websites.
    </p>
    <br />

    <strong>7. </strong>What is your impression of how the experience should be
    interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)

    <p>
      I feel like this website is designed for long-term engagement. It has a
      lot of interesting and unique features that are fun to interact with,
      giving users a reason to come back. As it is also his portfolio, it gives
      us a lot of information detailing his work with the previous examples. All
      this information would keep us engaged with the website for a long period
      of time.
    </p>
    <br />

    <strong>8. </strong>How does the interactive experience communicate how it
    should be interacted with over time?

    <p>
      His blend of intuitive design and interesting content captures our
      attention. Over time, his website will adapt, showcasing more of his
      projects, updates, and social media. This keeps the audience engaged and
      informed about his work, continuing to interact with all the website's
      content.
    </p>
    <br />

    <strong>9. </strong>What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the
    experience reference?

    <p>
      This website somehow reminds me of modern art exhibitions, such as the
      ACMI museum in Melbourne. A vibrant and colorful place with distinctive
      and special interactions/pieces. Later, as you travel down the website it
      displays each piece of work at a time, giving you a chance to view and
      experience the work yourself, like when you are walking down an
      exhibition.
    </p>
    <br />

    <strong>10. </strong>What does this reference/s communicate to you about how
    you should act when engaging with your research experience?

    <p>
      This makes us take our time when exploring his works. Going over the
      detail and process of why he did things a certain way and how the overall
      outcome of it came to be.
    </p>
    <br />

    <strong>11. </strong>What does this reference/s communicate to you about how
    you should feel when engaging with your research experience?

    <p>
      It makes us want to feel a sense of familiarity and excitement when
      engaging with it. The help with its simple setup and layout as well makes
      it an exciting and engaging experience, such as a child exploring an
      exhibition for the first time.
    </p>
    <br />

    <strong>12. </strong>What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to
    you and what makes that part frustrating?

    <p>
      The middle of the website, where it shows all the work, sometimes slows
      down and lags a little bit. Most likely due to the animation when hovering
      over it. It can be a little frustrating as well, as the image animation
      can distract you from the text displayed on the screen at the moment. Some
      of the writing is a bit too small as well.
    </p>
    <br />

    <strong>13</strong>
    What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes
    that part satisfying?

    <p>
      The most satisfying part would have to be the mouse hover. I think the
      movement was very satisfying. It is very cool to see how he created and
      modified the mouse for his website. Turning something very basic and
      ordinary into a creative interaction.
