      <strong>1. </strong> What was the first thing you paid attention to when
      interacting with the experience?
    </p>
    <p class="text-center">
      The first thing I paid attention to was my interaction with the mouse.
      Whenever I would move the mouse it had a white trail attached to it
      creating a cool effect similar to a snake. Its animation was very
      cartoonish yet fluid, reminding me of something off a video game.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>2. </strong> Spend two minutes with the experience and create a
      list of each of your discrete actions.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Moving around with the mouse</li>
      <li>Hovering over texts</li>
      <li>Hovering over images</li>
      <li>Scrolling down and horizontally</li>
      <li>Clicking links and buttons</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <strong>3. </strong> What part of the experience did you spend the most
      time engaging with?
    </p>
    <p>
      I spent the most time engaging in the middle of the website when he was
      showcasing all of his work he has created. His different works are linked
      in the title taking you to its page when you click on it. I spent a lot of
      time looking at his different work as well to see what he has done.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>4. </strong> What was the most common action in your two minute
      interaction with the experience?
    </p>
    <p>
      My most common action was simply hovering over texts and objects waiting
      for a response or effect to happen after. It was the action needed for
      most of the interactions to work and show the full effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>5. </strong> What is your impression of the intended primary goal
      of the interactive experience?
    </p>
    <p>
      The overall intention was probably for the website creator to showcase his
      overall skills for websites and coding. He wanted us to experience his own
      personal skills by implementing a fun website which we can interact and
      play with whilst also using his previous works as more examples for us to
      know about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>6. </strong>How does the interactive experience communicate this
      primary goal?
    </p>
    <p>
      His primary goal is to showcase his skills in website making. He was
      clearly able to showcase this by making multiple engaging interactions
      with the user. It shows and tells us his skills in creating websites that
      are very unique to most people.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>7. </strong>What is your impression of how the experience should
      be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)
    </p>

    <p>
      I feel like this website is designed for long-term engagement. It has a
      lot of interesting and unique features that are fun to interact with,
      giving users a reason to come back. As it is also his portfolio it gives
      us a lot of information detailing his work with the previous examples. All
      this information would keep us engaging with the website for a long period
      of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>8. </strong>How does the interactive experience communicate how it
      should be interacted with over time?
    </p>
    <p>
      His blend of intuitive design and interesting content captures our
      attention. Over time, his website will adapt, showcasing more of his
      projects, updates and social media. This keeps the audience engaged and
      informed about his work, continuing to interact with all the website's
      content.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>9. </strong>What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the
      experience reference?
    </p>
    <p>
      This website somehow reminds me of modern experimental art exhibitions,
      such as the ACMI museum in Melbourne city. A vibrant and colorful place
      with distinctive and special interactions/pieces. Later as you travel down
      the website it displays each piece of work at a time giving you a chance
      to view and experience the work yourself, like when walking down an
      exhibition.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>10. </strong>What does this reference/s communicate to you about
      how you should act when engaging with your research experience?
    </p>
    <p>
      This makes us take our time when exploring his works. Going over the
      detail and process of why he did things a certain way and how the overall
      outcome of it came to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>11. </strong>What does this reference/s communicate to you about
      how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?
    </p>
    <p>
      It makes us want to feel a sense of familiarity and excitement when
      engaging with it. The help with its simple setup and layout as well makes
      it an exciting and engaging experience such as a child exploring an
      exhibition for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>12. </strong>What is the most frustrating part of the interaction
      to you and what makes that part frustrating?
    </p>
    <p>
      The middle of the website where it shows all the work sometimes slows down
      and lags a little bit. Most likely due to the animation when hovering over
      it. It can be a little frustrating as well as the image animation can
      distract you from the text displayed on the screen at the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>13</strong>
      What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes
      that part satisfying?
    </p>
    <p>
      The most satisfying part would have to be the mouse hover. It is very cool
      to see how he created and modified the mouse for his website. Turning
      something very basic and ordinary into a creative interaction.
